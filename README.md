# Bank Churn Prediction üè¶

This repository presents an ML pipeline developed to predict customer churn in a bank using several classification models. The project includes proper experiment tracking using **MLflow**, providing visibility into model metrics and comparisons.

## üîç Problem Statement

Bank churn prediction is a classification problem that aims to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. Understanding this behavior helps the bank improve retention strategies.



## ‚úÖ Models Considered

The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with linear and RBF kernels  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model was logged and tracked using **MLflow**, including key metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

## üìä MLflow Visualization

We used MLflow to track and visualize the performance of each model across multiple metrics.

### Example Runs:

| Run Name            | Accuracy | F1 Score | Precision | Recall |
|---------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| SVM with RBF        | 0.7629   | 0.7526   | 0.7723    | 0.7338 |
| Random Forest       | 0.7653   | 0.7532   | 0.7794    | 0.7288 |
| Decision Tree       | 0.6934   | 0.6903   | 0.6852    | 0.6955 |
| SVM (Linear)        | 0.7629   | 0.7526   | 0.7723    | 0.7338 |
| Linear Regression   | 0.7065   | 0.6955   | 0.7093    | 0.6822 |

## üìå Key Takeaways

- **Random Forest** slightly outperformed the others in accuracy and precision.
- All models were evaluated on the same dataset using consistent metrics.
- Experiment tracking with **MLflow** enabled efficient comparison and reproducibility.
